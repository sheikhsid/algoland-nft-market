## Algoland Blockchain NFT Market Prototype

This is a prototype for an NFT (non-fungible token) market built on the Algoland blockchain using Laravel. The purpose of this project is to showcase the potential of the Algoland blockchain for creating decentralized markets for unique digital assets.

## Installation

To run this prototype, you will need to have PHP and the Laravel framework installed on your machine. You can install PHP from the official website [here](https://www.php.net/downloads.php), and the Laravel framework can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation).

Once you have PHP and Laravel installed, you can clone this repository and install the dependencies by running the following command:

composer install

## Usage

To start the prototype, you can run the following command:

php artisan serve

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000, where you can access the NFT market interface.
